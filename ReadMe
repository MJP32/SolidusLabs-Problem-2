# To run the program arguments must be a file and an integer amount


# What is the big O notation for your program?
# This is a recursive solution, first we sort the items which is O(n log n )

# The algorithm has to find all combinations and decides whether to add it to the results or not
#  so the Big O notation is: O (n^k) where n in the number of items and k is the number of gifts to buy



# Bonus
# To allow for 3 gifts instead of two
# comment line 7 and uncomment line 8 in BuyGifts.java

//public final static int NUMBER_ITEMS_TO_BUY = 2;
public final static int NUMBER_ITEMS_TO_BUY = 3;
